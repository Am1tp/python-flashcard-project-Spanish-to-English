A flashcard project designed to help the user to learn the most common words in a specified language (with English translation).

A flash card is displayed on screen to the user, using a randomly selected Spanish word from the dataset - after 3 seconds the flash card will 'flip' and on the reverse the English translation is shown.
The user can select the 'tick' button if they know the word, this will remove the word from the dataset so they will not be shown the word again in the future.
Otherwise the user can select the 'cross' button if they do not know the word/translation of the word, this will cause a new card to be shown to the user with another randomly selected word from the dataset.

Dataset sample from: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Spanish1000
500 of the most common words generated from tv and movie subtitles in Spanish were taken and the Spanish - English translations were done in Google Sheets using GOOGLETRANSLATE and exported in csv format
